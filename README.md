The project was commissioned by the Customer Insights Manager, 
VayuAir Australia (a fictitious airline). Their objective is to 
extract insights from the data and predict customer satisfaction while 
identifying the ways to boost customer engagement and retention. I rightly 
identified it as a classification problem and used the supervised machine 
learningâ€™s logistic regression approach through the LogisticRegression 
functionality from the scikit-learn library to solve this. Factors such as flight distance, online check
in quality, airport check-in process, baggage handling quality, cabin-crew 
service, seat comfort, inflight entertainment, inflight wifi, leg room, and 
cleanliness positively influence satisfaction. While maintaining and improving 
the quality of the factors positively influencing customer satisfaction, VayuAir 
should focus on improving service quality across the factors negatively 
influencing customer satisfaction through targeted actions. The expected value gains include enhanced 
customer retention, operational efficiency, great word-of-mouth, an increased 
customer based, and enhanced revenues.
