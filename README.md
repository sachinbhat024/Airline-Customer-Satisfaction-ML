The project was commissioned by the Customer Insights Manager, 
VayuAir (a ficticious airline). Their objective is to 
extract insights from the data and predict customer satisfaction while 
identifying the ways to boost customer engagement and retention. We have 
identified it as a classification problem and used the supervised machine 
learningâ€™s logistic regression approach through the use of LogisticRegression 
functionality from scikit-learn library to solve this. Flight distance, online check
in quality, airport check-in process, baggage handling quality, cabin-crew 
service, seat comfort, inflight entertainment, inflight wifi, leg room, and 
cleanliness positively influence satisfaction. While maintaining and improving 
the quality on the factors positively influencing customer satisfaction, VayuAir 
should highly focus on improving service quality across the factors negatively 
influencing customer satisfaction with targeted actions. Value gains: enhanced 
customer retention, operational efficiency, great word-of-mouth, an increased 
customer based, and enhanced revenues.
